            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto"> I am from Brazil and my first language is the most beautiful one, yes... Portuguese but Brazilian Portugues with the sing song spanish accent in there. I am these kind of people that just love to learn about everything that is under the sun. That's why my first guess in carrear would be Economics. Politics, History, Economy, People's decision all under the same graduation. Saying that I've loved to spend 4 years studying everything is an understantement. We even had oportunited to be a tad creative with Excel to explain the why(s) of so many variables.</p>
                
                <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto"> I've worked in the biggest latin american bank with investors relations but really I was resposible for schedulling payments in the system and right there I saw the need to learn English, I learned, studied in Canada for a month and came back ready to fly again... next stop Ireland. I love the Emerald island to death, learned so much more that irish English. Worked for a tech company prossessing orders and dive deep into data in there, I also had my fisrt opportunity to see how to dev.Had an opportunity to move to England about two years ago, and here I am also working for a tech company and I've decided to learn how to code and really dive into the tech revolution.</p>
